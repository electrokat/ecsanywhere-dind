# ECS Anywhere via Docker-in-Docker

In order to run ECS Anywhere you need a systemd and Docker. This repository is an approach for running that *within* Docker using a Docker-in-Docker approach.

The Dockerfile in this folder will build an Amazon Linux 2 container that has both systemd and docker that can serve as an ECS Anywhere sandbox for us.

On a machine with Docker Desktop installed and running run the following commands:
1. `git clone https://github.com/nikovirtala/amazonlinux-dind`
1. `cd ecsanywhere-dind`
1. `docker build -t ecsanywhere-dind .`
1. `docker run -d --privileged --name ecsanywhere -p 8080-8090:8080-8090 ecsanywhere-dind:latest`
1. `docker exec -it ecsanywhere /bin/bash`

We'll paste the command to join this to Systems manager and ECS into that interactive shell within the container in a moment.

Then in the AWS Console:
1. Go to the ECS Service
1. Click the blue `Create Cluster` button
1. Choose Networking only (should already be selected by default) and click the blue `Next step` button
1. Type `ECSAnywhere` for the Cluster name, click the box to enable CloudWatch Container Insights, and then click the blue `Create` button
1. Click the blue `View Cluster` button
1. Go to the ECS Instances tab in the middle of hhe console
1. Click the `Register External Instances` button
1. Click the blue `Next step` button
1. Click the blue `Copy` button to copy the command we need to the clipboard

Then just paste that command in to the interactive shell within our ecsanywhere-dind container to register this container against both SSM and ECS Anywhere.

Note that this is a separate nested docker and network within the one on your Mac/Win machine (which itself is separate Linux VM on those machines) . This means that:
* You won't see the containers ECS launches by doing a `docker ps` on the host - you'll need to do a `docker exec` into the running ecsanywhere container and do the `docker ps` there to see them.
* There is a double NATing happening (ecsanywhere-dind->Docker Desktop->Host). We have exposed the range 8080-8090 in the `docker run` example above so you need to ensure that your ECS-scheduled containers use hostports in that range to be able to access them from a browser on your PC/Mac host - or change the ports/range in that command to meet your needs if that doesn't.

Once you have started the container you can do a `docker stop ecsanywhere` to pause it and `docker start ecsanywhere` to start it up again when you need - it'll retain the ECS cluster membership until you do a `docker rm` and remove the container from your system.

To remove it from both SSM and ECS Anywhere go to the Fleet Manager in the SMS service and deregister it there.
